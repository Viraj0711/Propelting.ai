# Propelting 🚀

## Turn Meetings into Momentum

**Propelting** is an AI-powered meeting intelligence platform that automatically converts conversations into summaries, action items, and tracked tasks—so teams spend less time remembering and more time executing.

Propelting listens to meetings, understands context, identifies decisions, assigns ownership, and integrates directly into your existing workflow tools like JIRA, Slack, and Google Calendar.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Meetings are where decisions are made—but they are also where execution breaks down.

### Common Challenges

* Important action items are forgotten or poorly documented
* Manual note-taking distracts participants
* Ownership and deadlines are unclear
* Follow-ups require manual work across multiple tools
* Meeting recordings go unused due to time constraints

### The Result

* Lost productivity
* Missed deadlines
* Poor accountability
* Slower execution

Modern teams need meetings to **produce outcomes**, not just conversations.

## 💡 Solution Overview

**Propelting** acts as an AI meeting co-pilot that automatically:

* Transcribes meetings with high accuracy
* Identifies speakers and context
* Generates structured summaries
* Extracts action items with owners and deadlines
* Assigns priority using sentiment and urgency detection
* Syncs tasks to project management tools
* Sends reminders and follow-ups automatically

Propelting closes the gap between **discussion and execution**.
